                <h3>EBF Cut – concept arts and file architecting</h3>
                <p>In this project I analyzed and modified the file structure of an existing game to inject my own concept art and content.</p>
                <p><strong>Short description:</strong> I used HxD to inspect files on the hex level, Resource Hacker to manipulate resources, and JPEXS to explore embedded graphical assets. The goal was to understand how a game is built “under the hood” and how this can be used creatively.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Project PP is a point and click adventure game starring Feri, a resident of the small Hungarian village Nagyhuta. His big dream is to escape local poverty, leave behind the isolated village life and start over in the big city as a politician.</p>
                <p>The problem is that almost everything is working against him: there is no bus, no train, no money and barely any job opportunities. The player follows Feri on this absurd, sometimes bittersweet journey where every small decision matters.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere mixes the vibe of a Hungarian village with real social issues, dark humour and satire. Storytelling, character motivation and the fragile hope of “breaking out” are at the heart of the project.</p>
